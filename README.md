# Appendix B - Further reading
Ok, I know it, this isn't much :p

##[The official guide](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.0.0/guide_plugin-development_index.md.html)

## [PhoneGap plugins at GitHub](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins)
This is an exelent place to look for more information. Pick some example close 
to what you need and see how others solve the problem - easiest way to learn IMO.

## The #PhoneGap irc channel on Freenode.net
Good place to ask when in doubt.
