# Example: 5 - Events with arguments

Added some result data to example 4.

## Interesting files:

### pgplugins/Plugins/PluginExamples.m and pgplugins/Plugins/PluginExamples.h
Added a simple JavaScript object to the payload, to 
enable sending data with the event.

### www/pluginExample.js
Just standard JavaScript.
